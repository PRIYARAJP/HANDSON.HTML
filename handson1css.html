        <h2>What is CSS</h2>
            <ol style="color: brown; ">
                <li style="margin: 0.5cm;">CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
                <li style="margin: 0.5cm;">CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li>
                <li style="margin: 0.5cm;"><del>CSS is not neccesary</del> <mark>CSS saves a lot of work.</mark>  It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once                </li>
                <li style="margin: 0.5cm;"><ins>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</ins>
                </li>
            </ol><br>
        <H2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</H2>
        <ul style="color: brown; letter-spacing: 3px ;"">
            <li>Inline by using the style attribute inside HTML elementsl </li>
            <li>Internal by using a style element in the head section</li>
            <li>External by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.            </li>
            <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However,<mark> in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles, </mark> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the clement.
        </p>
        <p>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Peth are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.
